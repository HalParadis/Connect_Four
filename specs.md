As users playing a two player game we want to:

[X]    enter our names and have them displayed
[X]    have our order chosen for us by the game
[X]    take turns by dropping our chip into a column on the grid
[X]    not be able to drop a chip into a totally filled column
[X]    be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
[X]    start the game over without having to reset the browser

As a user playing a single player game I additionally want to:

[X]    see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
[X]    have the Computer player choose columns as if it were a human player

As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:

[ ]    the Computer chooses the correct column for a win, when possible
